This was a project for my database implementation class, focused on building a relational database management system from the ground up. The system implements the classic layered database architecture, starting from raw file I/O and building up to table operations and indexing. At the lowest level, a File Manager handles block-level disk access, treating storage as fixed-size blocks. Above that, a Log Manager implements write-ahead logging (WAL) to ensure crash recovery and durability. The Buffer Manager maintains an in-memory cache of disk blocks, using eviction policies like CLOCK to optimize performance when the buffer pool is full. The Transaction module provides full ACID guarantees by coordinating a Concurrency Manager (for isolation via locking) and a Recovery Manager (for atomicity via undo/redo logging). Records are stored in blocks using a Schema and Layout system that maps logical field definitions to physical byte offsets. A Table Manager maintains the system catalog, tracking metadata about all tables and their fields. For efficient data access, an Index Manager supports static hash indexing to map search keys directly to record locations. All together, the system demonstrates how a production database works internally—from the moment bytes hit the disk to the moment a query retrieves structured data from a table.
